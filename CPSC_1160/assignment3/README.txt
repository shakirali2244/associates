For finding the smallest value of N for which P is close to 0.5, I wrote a function to generate random int array to contain peoples' birthdays 
for different values of N and calculated C/T for each value. 
I came to the conclusion that the smallest value of N for which P(C/T) is closest to 0.5 is 23. 
I ran the simulation function multiple times for range of values to come up to this conclusion.
What it means is if we take 23 random in a room and ask for their birthday there is a 50% chance that 2 of them will have same birthday.
