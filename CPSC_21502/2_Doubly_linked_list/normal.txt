An algorithm specifies a series of steps that perform a particular computation or task. Algorithms were originally born as part of mathematics – the word “algorithm” comes from the Persian writer Muammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, – but currently the word is strongly associated with computer science. 
Studying algorithms is a fundamental part of computer science. There are several different characteristics of an algorithm that are useful to know:
Does an algorithm actually exist to perform a given task?
If someone proposes an algorithm to solve a task, are we sure that the algorithm works for all possible inputs?
How long does the algorithm take to run? How much memory space does it require?
Once we know it’s possible to solve a problem with an algorithm, a natural question is whether the algorithm is the best possible one. Can the problem be solved more quickly?
